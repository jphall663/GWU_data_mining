## Data Science Interview Questions

#### Background
* Why do you want this, specific job?
* What is the business model of this company?
* How does data science fit into this company's business model?

#### Technical
* What is the curse of dimensionality and how should one deal with it when building machine-learning models?
* Why is a comma a bad record separator/delimiter?
* Explain the difference between a compiled computer language and an interpreted computer language.
* How do you determine “k” for k-means clustering? Or, how do you determine the number of clusters in a data set?
* What’s more important: predictive power or interpretability of a model?
* Explain finite precision. Why is finite precision a problem in machine learning?
* Explain the “bias-variance trade-off” and why it is fundamental to machine learning.
* Describe a recent use of logistic regression.
* Give examples of data cleaning techniques you have used in the past.
* What subjects would you include in a one-day data science crash course? And why?
* Describe a situation where you had to decide between two different types of analyses – and why you chose the one you did.
* Explain the benefits of test-driven software development; or explain the benefits of unit testing.

#### Communication
* Describe an analysis you have recently completed, including strategies and findings. How were the findings used by the business? (This can be from a student research project or thesis if the candidate is a recent graduate.)
* Explain to the leaders of this company what model lift is and why they should care.
* How do you identify and overcome obstacles (during projects, with customers, with decision makers, etc.)?
* Tell me about a project you worked on that succeeded in part because of the way results were communicated.
* What is your favorite data visualization book or blog? And why?
* How would you design a chart or graph for a color-blind audience?
* Tell me a compelling story about data that you have analyzed.
* Explain to a business analyst the trade-off between the predictive power and the interpretability of a model – and why this matters.
